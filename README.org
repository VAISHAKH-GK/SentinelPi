SentinelPi is a Raspberry Pi powered modular hardware penetration testing platform designed for controlled security research and academic demonstration. The device integrates multiple physical and wireless attack vectors into a unified embedded system with a dedicated touchscreen interface.

The project focuses on understanding hardware-level vulnerabilities, wireless communication weaknesses, and interface exploitation techniques in a controlled and ethical environment.

* Overview
SentinelPi combines multiple security assessment modules into a single portable embedded platform. Each module operates independently and is managed through a unified graphical interface.

The system is designed for:
- Academic research
- Security awareness demonstrations
- Controlled penetration testing labs
- Embedded systems experimentation

* Features

**** Modular Architecture
- Each attack vector is implemented as an independent module.
- Modules can be started and stopped dynamically from the UI.
- Subprocess-based execution for stability and isolation.

**** Bad USB Simulation
- STM32-based USB HID emulation.
- Demonstrates keystroke injection techniques.
- Useful for studying endpoint security mechanisms.

**** 2.4 GHz Wireless Testing
- nRF24L01+PA+LNA module integration.
- Channel analysis and signal experimentation.
- Demonstrates wireless protocol weaknesses.

**** RFID / NFC Testing
- PN532 integration.
- RFID tag reading and interaction.
- Security evaluation of proximity-based systems.

**** Infrared Command Injection
- IR transmitter and receiver support.
- Replay and capture of IR signals.
- Demonstration of consumer device vulnerabilities.

**** Touchscreen Interface
- 7-inch HDMI display.
- Fullscreen kiosk-style interface.
- Real-time module status monitoring.

**** Process Management System
- Non-blocking execution model.
- Safe start/stop handling.
- Crash recovery capability.

* System Architecture

The platform follows a modular layered architecture:

1. User Interface Layer (Kivy-based GUI)
2. Core Process Manager
3. Hardware Module Layer
4. Device Driver / GPIO Layer

Each module runs independently and communicates only through defined interfaces to maintain stability and extensibility.

* Hardware Components

- Raspberry Pi (Primary Controller)
- nRF24L01+PA+LNA (2.4 GHz wireless module)
- PN532 (RFID/NFC module)
- STM32 (Bad USB controller)
- IR Transmitter and Receiver
- 7-inch HDMI Touchscreen
- External regulated power supply

* Software Stack

- Python 3
- Kivy (Touchscreen UI Framework)
- SPI / GPIO interfaces
- Subprocess-based module execution
- Linux systemd service for boot management

* Installation and Setup

***** 1. Clone the repository
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/SentinelPi.git
cd SentinelPi
#+end_src

***** 2. Install dependencies
#+begin_src bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+end_src

***** 3. Run application (development mode)
#+begin_src bash
python3 app/main.py
#+end_src

***** 4. Optional: Enable auto-start (production mode)
Configure systemd service from the scripts/ directory.

* Usage

- Boot device
- System launches directly into fullscreen interface
- Select desired module
- Start / Stop operations using touchscreen controls
- Monitor module status in real time

* Security and Ethical Use

SentinelPi is strictly intended for:

- Educational purposes
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research in controlled environments

Unauthorized use against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.
